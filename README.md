# Text Editor - Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Challenge
The starter code was provided by GTBootcamp. It was ready to be deployed.I have studied it and added the necessary dependencies and workbox plugins then I deployed it to Heroku

This project is part of a Progressive Web Applications (PWA) challenge and aims to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The application will be a single-page application with offline functionality and data persistence using IndexedDB.

## Project Overview
The text editor will allow users to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection. The application will provide data redundancy through multiple data persistence techniques, ensuring reliable retrieval of saved content. Users will be able to use the text editor even when offline, and their content will be automatically saved to the IndexedDB database.



## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- IndexedDB
- idb package
- Webpack
- Service Worker
- Workbox
- Heroku
